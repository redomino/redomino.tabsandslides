Every view can be applied to a folder or a collection.

Created by Maurizio Lupo for redomino in 2011.

TODO
--------
1 - delete most of the adapters (leave some example only)
2 - add a series of content type images to use in galleries and tabbed previews
3 - substitute adapter with browserviews (In this way I can customize them using a layer interface)
4 - modify boxscrollable plugin (remember to keep the tests updated):
    - do not manage left and right buttons 
    - manage scroll using position relative instead scroll
    - implement cycle between images
    - auto resize
3 - use only 2 templates, use only 2 class
    - refactor css
    - refactor js
4 - use multiadapters to load js (optional)
